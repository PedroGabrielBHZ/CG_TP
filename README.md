# Computer Graphics Showcase

This project is a showcase of algorithms for drawing computer graphics primitives implemented in Python. It uses the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface.

## Features

- Line drawing using Bresenham's algorithm and DDA
- Circle drawing using Bresenham's algorithm
- Line clipping using Cohen-Sutherland and Liang-Barsky algorithms
- Geometric transformations (translation, rotation, scaling)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
