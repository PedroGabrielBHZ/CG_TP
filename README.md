# Computer Graphics Showcase

This project is a simple GUI application that demonstrates the use of two fundamental computer graphics algorithms: Bresenham's line algorithm and the Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) line algorithm.

## Features

- Draw lines using Bresenham's line algorithm
- Draw lines using the DDA line algorithm
- Clear the canvas

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run `main.py`:

```sh
python main.py
```

## Usage

Enter the coordinates for the start and end points of the line in the input fields and click either "Show Bresenham" or "Show DDA" to draw the line using the respective algorithm. Click "Clear" to clear the canvas.

## Files

- `main.py`: The entry point of the application.
- `windows.py`: Contains the `MainWindow` class, which is responsible for creating the GUI.
- `algorithms.py`: Contains the implementations of Bresenham's line algorithm and the DDA line algorithm.
